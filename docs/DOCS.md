# Project's API Documentation

This directory contains documentation about developed source code modules.<br>
In order to build an *html* version of it, use available makefile.<br>
Then, you can open *_build/html/index.html* with the browser of your choice.

> I recommend that you use [run_dev.sh](../config/CONFIG.md#developer-container) because it conveniently maps the<br>
> entire repository as a volume.

```bash
  pwd
  # <...>/DeepPantry/docs

  make html
```
