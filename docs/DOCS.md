# Project's API Documentation

This directory contains documentation about developed source code modules.<br>
In order to build an *html* version of it, use available makefile.

```bash
  pwd
  # <...>/DeepPantry/docs
  make html
```

Then, you can open *_build/html/index.html* with the browser of your choice.
